# TaskBot :book:
TaskBot is a simple bot that manages your tasks through **simple** commands. It does:
- Adding various types of tasks, specifying dates if needed
- Listing tasks
- Marking tasks as done or undone
- Deleting tasks
- Sorting tasks based on various parameters
- Saving and loading tasks from local memory

All you need to do is:
1. Head to [the site of my fork](https://github.com/salmonkarp/ip).
2. Go to the Releases section
3. Download the .jar file
4. Put it into an empty folder, and run by clicking it or running `java -jar "taskBot.jar"` in a terminal.
5. Enjoy!

Alternatively, you can also clone the repo and build it yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/salmonkarp/ip.git
```

What the plan is going forward:
- [X] Create GUI using FXML
- [X] Add more commands
- [X] Use variable arguments
- [X] Enhance GUI
